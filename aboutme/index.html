    <p>My name is Collin Breshears and I am a software engineering major. I currently work at Hernandez Hot Rods and Customs in Rexburg and although I love it, can't justify the pay for the rest of my life. I also just married the love of my life at the end of July! 
        I have an older sister who is married and has 2 kids that lives in Idaho Falls, an older brother who is a journeyman electrician in Nampa, a twin sister who is getting married in December and is graduating from BYU-Idaho in December, and a younger brother who is serving a mission in Las Vegas and will be home next September! 
        I love anything that has an engine and anything that involves complex systems. Learning how things work and finding ways to make things more reliable and work better has always been a passion of mine!</p>
